# Microtonal-Ratio-to-Detune-Calculator
In this GNU Octave project, we allow user to calculate detune values depending on the root note selected and desired note to detune.
You can use the detune values to retune your synths or DAWs such as Logic Pro, Cubase and Bitwig Studio and use the same in notation editor aswell
that supports microtonality.
